This class provides a method for encrypting a message using the Caesar cipher.
The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.
The method takes an alphabet, a list of excluded characters, the message to be encrypted, and the shift value as parameters.
The encrypted message is returned as a string.
Considerations: The method assumes a fixed alphabet of 26 characters and is case-sensitive. The handling of non-alphabetic characters may be extended based on specific use cases.
